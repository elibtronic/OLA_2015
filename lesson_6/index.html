<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<p>We will be working with a visualization package called <em>D3 Plus</em>, which is a simpler version of the more D3 platform. <br>
This works by using JavaScript and HTML to generate visualizations. <br>
The visualizations will use exported data from OpenRefine in a format called JSON. <br>
JSON is pretty universal data format that hopefully you have seen before.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="d3files.zip">Zip</a> file with the JS files.</p>

<p>Create a new folder somewhere and extract all the files there.</p>

<p>You should see 4 files</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="pie.html">pie.html</a> - we are going to make a pie graph showing some data from our EZproxy log</li>
<li><a href="bar.html">bar.html</a> - We are going to draw a bar chart from our farm data</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this let us look at the structure of the HTML files:</p>
