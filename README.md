_Abstract_: This session will be an interactive look at how to grab data from the web and get it to do your bidding. A combination of tools will be used to conjure up real world Library examples. By utilizing the various utilities and the data analysis tool Open Refine a step by step tutorial will look at building a data visualization from start to finish. This will be an introductory session perfect for the absolute novice. The only requirement is a laptop and your curiosity.

Repo has the lesson plans and the slides I used.
