## Twitter ##

### Step 1 ###

Recently Twitter started to allow users to download their total tweet archive as a bundle of different files. In that bundle of files was a CSV file that had a bunch of metadata in it.
This can be handy if you have a twitter account in your library and you want to figure out how you are reaching your users.

### Step 2 ###

Download my [archive](tweets.csv).  Apologies in advance, there are swears.

### Step 3 ###

Since we have done a few lessons now, let us try:

- What day is the best for Re-tweets
- How many times have I used a hashtag?
- How many times have I used the #darthvendor hashtag
- Using a time facet what time frame produces the most tweets? (_Hint:_ Split & a Transform to Date will be necessary)
- Bonus points - How many time has the s word been used?
- Real bonus - can you get a list of all of the hashtags I've used?
