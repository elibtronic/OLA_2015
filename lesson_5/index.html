<p>Recently Twitter started to allow users to download their total tweet archive as a bundle of different files. In that bundle of files was a CSV file that had a bunch of metadata in it. <br>
This can be handy if you have a twitter account in your library and you want to figure out how you are reaching your users.</p>

<ul>
<li>What day is the best for Re-tweets</li>

<li>How many times have I used a hashtag?</li>
<li>How many times have I used the #darthvendor hashtag</li>
<li>Using a time facet what time frame produces the most tweets? (<em>Hint:</em> Split &amp; a Transform to Date will be necessary)</li>
<li>Bonus points - How many time has the s word been used?</li>
<li>Real bonus - can you get a list of all of the hashtags I've used?</li>
</ul>
