<h2 id="some-census-data">Some Census Data</h2>

<p>We will be looking at <em>Census of Agriculture, 2011</em> data.  </p>

<p>Available here: <a href="http://odesidownload.scholarsportal.info/documentation/AgCensus/2011/agcensus2011.html">http://odesidownload.scholarsportal.info/documentation/AgCensus/2011/agcensus2011.html</a> <br>
This is a snippet from the Livestock, poultry and bees data sheet</p>

<h2 id="step-1">step 1</h2>

<p>Download the excel spreadsheet: <a href="Livestock.xlsx">Livestock</a> and create a new project with it.</p>

<p>Looks pretty messy to me. (I have already cleaned it up a bunch btw.)</p>



<h2 id="step-2">step 2</h2>

<p>It would be interesting to see what the provincial totals might be.  How could we do that? (Hint: Sorting or faceting will figure this out) What province has reported highest <em>Column</em></p>

<p>Let us try to clean up the Provincial data while we are at it.</p>



<h2 id="step-3">step 3</h2>

<p>how many farms are they missing data from?</p>



<h2 id="step-4">step 4</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Column</em> was how many farms were reporting</li>
<li><em>Column2</em> was how many year old calves were reported by the farm. Let us change the column names so that it makes sense</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-5">step 5</h2>

<p>What is the average number of cattle per farm per province?</p>
