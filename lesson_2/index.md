## Some Census Data ##

We will be looking at _Census of Agriculture, 2011_ data.  

Available here: http://odesidownload.scholarsportal.info/documentation/AgCensus/2011/agcensus2011.html
This is a snippet from the Livestock, poultry and bees data sheet

## step 1 ##
Download the excel spreadsheet: [Livestock](Livestock.xlsx) and create a new project with it.

Looks pretty messy to me. (I have already cleaned it up a bunch btw.)

## step 2 ##
It would be interesting to see what the provincial totals might be.  How could we do that? (Hint: Sorting or faceting will figure this out) What province has reported highest _Column_

Let us try to clean up the Provincial data while we are at it.

## step 3 ##
how many farms are they missing data from?

## step 4 ##
- _Column_ was how many farms were reporting
- _Column2_ was how many year old calves were reported by the farm. Let us change the column names so that it makes sense

## step 5 ##
What is the average number of cattle per farm per province?
