<p>As part of the hackfest yesterday we were given some <a href="SC_data.xls">data</a> on attendees for the conference. We then used this data to draw out some maps of where everyone came from.  The data was great, but it was a bit messy. Let's spend some time cleaning it up.</p>
<p>Here is a bit of text that will help us out:</p>
<p><code>^[ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY]{1}\d{1}[A-Z]{1} *\d{1}[A-Z]{1}\d{1}$</code></p>
<p>What other neat stuff can you find?</p>
