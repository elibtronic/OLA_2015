## OLA Attendee Data ##


As part of the hackfest yesterday we were given some [data](SC_data.xls) on attendees for the conference. We then used this data to draw out some maps of where everyone came from.  The data was great, but it was a bit messy. Let's spend some time cleaning it up.

Here is a bit of text that will help us out:

`^[ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY]{1}\d{1}[A-Z]{1} *\d{1}[A-Z]{1}\d{1}$`


What other neat stuff can you find?
