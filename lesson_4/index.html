<h2 id="ez-proxy-log-files">EZ proxy Log Files</h2>

<p>The great thing about OpenRefine is that it can understand a wide variety of different types of input files</p>

<p>In this lesson we are going to look a (purposefully obscured) snapshot of an ezproxy log file</p>



<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>

<p>Download this <a href="./clf_mod.txt">text</a> file and have a look at it in your text editor.</p>

<p><em>Please Note!</em>Sorry, I have some reservation posting one of our log files even if it was anonymized. If you have EZproxy running you should be able to grab a recent logfile and do the same activities.</P>

<p>we will need to understand before we get into the lesson is what an IP address looks like. Basically it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="02.png" alt="02" title=""></p>

<p>The number dot notation essentially creates your unique address on the web so that web content can be delivered right to you. <br>
It is also handy because most IP address have been tied to physical locations. <br>
Big institutions often have a <em>block</em> of IP addresses that follow a larger pattern</p>

<p>EZproxy logs everything into a structure called CLF (<em>Common Log Format</em>) and this is standard seen in many different web applications. <br>
Apache for example. <br>
Here is a capture of two lines from that file.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>

<p>Load the file into Refine and split it into columns based on spaces</p>



<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Based on Column 2 how many individual sessions were there</li>
<li>Our pretend campus is located at IP address 439.62.*.* how many requests came from that IP address Range?</li>
<li>By mangling the last column can you create a list of traffic that was just to <em>www.tanfonline.com</em> and <em>scholar.google.com</em> (Hint, excesive use of split is required). How many users was this? Can you see any other interesting info?</li>
</ul>
